        Five-year program that combines system engineering with computing. The program required
        a semester-long co-op and two capstone team projects for graduation. For our first
        capstone project, my group developed a book library system in C using a third-party
        BTree file management utility for data storage and search.For the second
        capstone, my group developed MENUTIL, a menuing system--before the Windows era--that made easy to access
        applications installed in the computer. It also included a messaging system 
        for multi-user computers and a contact information system.

        I took a break in my professional career to get back to the academia. 
        I spent three years at RIT working towards a Ph.D in Computing and 
        Information Sciences. I completed the coursework, but then I realized
        that research wasn't my thing. I was missing industry so much that I decided to get back.
        Prior to getting back to the industry, I had the opportunity to spent a Summer at IBM Research in
        Hawthorne, NY, were I started the development of a expert system that was eventually granted with
        a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10042844B2/). 

          - Conducted research on Software Product Lines and feature configuration and composition
          - Present "Feature-Driven Configuration Management" at the First Graduate Research Symposium
