        Five-year program that combines system engineering with computing. The program required
        a semester-long co-op and two capstone team projects for graduation. For our first
        capstone project, my group developed a book library system in C using a third-party
        BTree file management utility for data storage and search.For the second
        capstone, my group developed MENUTIL, a menuing system--before the Windows era--that made easy to access
        applications installed in the computer. It also included a messaging system 
        for multi-user computers and a contact information system.
